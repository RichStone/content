# The Pefect Set Up to Write your Content in Markdown and CrossPost it to Webflow, dev.to, GitHub, Medium & codementor

This is Your ultimate guide that proposes a solution to write your blog in
markdown and to cross post it to different platforms. There are tons of tips on
how to set up your IWE (Integrated Writer's Environment) and even a few goodies
on marketing as well as on content creation.

It will be of special interest to you if you use webflow to host your blog. But
you will also find big interesting bites if you have a developer or a technical
blog which comes with its own pecularities and fun parts. Or maybe you'd like to
open source your blog too?

By the way, I just always wanted to write that something's an "Ultimate Guide",
but actually it's just a bunch of paragraphs. It will be probably an eternal
WIP, and if you are a happy person, i.e. you are reading this on its original
place of spawnment ([fullstack.coach]()) or on GitHub(YOU NERD!) or on dev.to,
then you will always have the most up to date version of it. Congrats!

## Why cross post

If you are in the beginning with your blog, writing can feel lonely. Especially
if you took the hard route and decided to self-host your blog, as opposed to
using a blogging platform like dev.to or Medium, you will lack essential
engagement and feedback which are crucial to nurture your writing and
motivation. I'd like to propose to go out there and make your content as visible
as possible on different platforms.

But how do you keep your posts **consistent on the different platforms**? What
if you have badass blog post that you want to extend or update over time? What
if you want to make your blog open source so that others can contribute to your
work? How do you keep SEO happy? And probably the most important question, how
do you keep your writing in the beloved markdown??

## Enter CrossPost üîÆ

CrossPost is a tool that I wrote on some occasional free time slots. Like a
magic ball, it's intended to solve all the issues described above. At the
moment, it has great capabilities to let you write markdown in webflow,
automatically publish your articles on webflow and on dev.to.

Medium and codementor don't have public APIs for publishing articles but I will
outline how to make your life easier if you decide to go the extra mile to
publish there as well. In the end, you can't be sure where your best audience
will be, unless you try it out.

I am open to integrating new platforms with CrossPost or describing them here in
more depth, feel free to suggest anything or fire up a pull request!

## Perequisites

Let's talk some serious stuff first, so that we have a common standpoint when we
speak about systematic cross-posting.

### content consistency

- particularly important as soon as you start writing pillar content

[...]

### canonical URLs

- Google does not like duplicate content

[...]

### self-hosting a blog

With self-hosting I don't mean you need to deploy your blog on a Linux server. I
mean owning your content more than you would do at dev.to and especially Medium.

You own your content more, whenever you use a platform that allows you to
provide additional content in other formats that could interest your readers and
if you can place a newsletter subscription somewhere.

Ultimately, if you "own" your content space at least for a bit, you'll be able
to turn on some ads in case you become a traffic magnet at some point (although
I wouldn't go with anything else than a trusted platform: [carbon
ads](https://www.carbonads.net/) especially with a developer blog).

You might find dev.to, Medium and codementor handy now but you won't be able to
do any of the above with them later.

I consider platforms like Wordpress already self-hosted, because you own it
enough. I can't cope with the plugin environment of Wordpress which is also the
reason why I actively advise for a [developer-friendly alternative LINK TO BLOG
POST OF THE GUYS]() that I use myself: Webflow ([affiliate ü§© link]()).

## IWE - Integrated Writer Environment

Everything starts with your work place, or write place in this case. I'd suggest
the following perequisites:

1. distraction-free as possible
1. help with your grammar and style
1. markdown-friendly
1. format-friendly

Writing directly in Grammarly will probably make you the Hemingway of developer
blogs, but in fact it won't. It's super destructive, if the all-knowing and
all-mighty Grammarly is throwing you something in the face after every 3 words
that you write.

It's not a secret that especially the first draft should be written in some kind
of a flow that reflects your own thoughts and style. That's why editor routine
looks like this:

1. write the first draft in VSCode
1. full proof-read and edit not earlier as the next day
1. check your writing with Grammarly

Checking your spelling and grammar with Grammarly can be tricky, especially if
you are writing in rich text formats since copy/pasting ~~can~~ will mess up
your format.

Grammarly seems to work fine with markdown, though. And there is even a plugin
for VSCode, so that you don't have to leave your editor ever.

You will also install the markdownlint plugin, so that you are kept up to date
about any issues you introduce by chaotically typing things.

A super cool feature of blogging in VSCode with markdownlint are links and
images. I would hate to interrupt... (Wow that's scary, as I wrote the word
"interrupt" my wife called to ask me about whether I've bought some corn üåΩ)
...interrupt the writing flow to search for some links or to upload some images
into the cloud. You can just write your markdown like this in markdown:

```markdown
Never know where that stupid ([affiliate ü§© link]() is,
so, I just procrastinate with it, until the final edit.
Sometimes, I also don't like adding pictures on the fly,
especially if I have to upload them first, so,
in all agility, I do this:

IMAGE TITLE - markdownlint does not like this:
![]()
```

So that in the end it looks something like this:

MARKDOWNLINT VALIDATION.png
![]()

This is impossible to miss on your final edit, no matter how late or early it is
that I'm writing this stuff (and yeah, I missed lots of them). It's a fail-safe
system :troll: (even better: For the next version of CrossPost, I plan an
automation where you will only need to add the local path to VSCode. WIN-WIN.)

Finally, consider installing the Rewrap plugin. It will help you wrap your
writing at 80 characters to keep your markdown smoothly pressed together into a
nicely readable chunk of bytes. It's maybe not the most friendly solution, but
it's what I have at the moment for that.

> Since you are all set up with your markdown and IWE now, let's bash your
content out to the different spaces and places üöÄ

## GitHub

Especially if you are a developer, GitHub might be a very interesting platform
for your content. I use GitHub for various reasons:

1. it makes collaboration on content potentially easier
1. it lets me open source my content to share the authorship with others
1. it lets me version control my content
1. it supports markdown

Make sure you don't have your content in the master branch of your repository
since these are indexed by Google and there is no technical possibility, that
I'm aware of, to set a canonical URL in GitHub for the master repo.

## .github.io

Maybe you'd like to host your blog completely on `your-user.github.io`? Since
there are many different approaches and I don't host on .github.io at the moment
myself there is no concrete CrossPost automation for now. But let me know if
you'd be interested in something like this and I will see if I can build a
solution there :)

## Webflow

When it comes to a full stack developer portfolio or blog, my take is:

1. Don't fiddle too much with your portfolio - Your resources are better spent
   on web applications!
1. It has to look well-designed - By default!
1. It has to be low maintenance - And still fully controllable!

This is what I personally get from webflow. While building my portfolio/blog
page, it somehow turned into [fullstack.coach](https://fullstack.coach), but no
worries I'll set up a portfolio sample soon to give you an example.

I'll post more on this in my coming portfolio guide, keep tuned! üìª If you like
the idea of webflow already, make sure to register via my link and let me know
if you did so (You'll be honored with big kudos :))).

## dev.to

There is no place like dev.to for software developer and technical bloggers!

[...]

## Medium

I wouldn't say I despise Medium. So many developers gave their lives to Medium.
And still, in 2020, there is no code beautifier? Really?

And that's just the bird crap on the tip of the iceberg of Medium's crimes. üêß
But at they do allow for a canonical URL which shocked me up to paralization!
And they to have users, lots of users, potentially even users that might find
usefulness or joy in your content.

So, if you still want to be seen there, we'll need to add some additional steps
to our ignorance and hypocracy to push through it until our blog reaches organic
traffic with at least a few thousands of visitors per month (feel free to
suggest a different metric, I'll go for it!).

- step 1: import post
- step 2: add your code snippets
  [...]

## codementor

Codementor - last and probably **least**, since the codementor blogging space
probably has not won any popularity awards yet. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

It has a nice markdown editor, but I don't have the feeling of big activity on
the platform yet. In any case, an additional pair of eyes or two on your content
won't hurt, and you will find that you are in the right place if you have some
good coaching, mentoring or problem-solving articles going down! With the right
content, a codementor article will go viral too!

As of now codementor's API doesn't give a damn about POSTing your article's
there in an automated way, so that you will actually even at this developer
focused place need to take the mouse in your hands and click around (sad and
boring, I know).
