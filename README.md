# Blog Content

This is the place where my personal blog content is stored. The majority of it is stored in markdown, some of it is cross posted with the [CrossPost NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crosspost) to my webflow blog (https://fullstack.coach), dev.to, Medium &amp; codementor.

You will find the content under the `content` branch of this repository (to not confuse Google and SEO with indexing the content from master).
